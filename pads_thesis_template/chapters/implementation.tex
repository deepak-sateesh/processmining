This section is only needed if there are non-trivial parts of your approach that require clarification.
You do not need to show the design of your code, or, pseudo code.
Only focus on non-trivial aspects.

For example, the Inductive Miner~\cite{DBLP:conf/apn/LeemansFA13} clearly describes the requirements for the \enquote{cuts} that it finds.
How you actually compute these cuts, i.e., combined with correctness proofs w.r.t. the requirements posed, is a good example of what can be added here.

Ideally, your previous chapter is so clear, that you do not need this chapter :-), i.e., implementing it is simply clear from the description.
