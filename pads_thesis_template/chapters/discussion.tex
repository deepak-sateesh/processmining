In this section, you discuss your general approach.
What design decisions did you make, and, what are the implications of this?
Maybe your approach computes an exact intermediary result, which is costly in terms of time.
Does a suitable approximation approach exist?
What are the implications for that approach.
You can also dive deeper in very related work and explain why it does not work in certain cases.
